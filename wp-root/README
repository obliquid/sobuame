to let sobuame authenticate users against a wordpress installation, you must properly configure the file app.js (at least set app.sbam.config.wpSiteUrl and app.sbam.config.mysql) and then put the file wp-auth-sobuame.php (without any modification) in the root folder of the wordpress site specified in app.sbam.config.wpSiteUrl
